## üìù Project Description: Online Bookstore Database

The **Online Bookstore Database** is a structured relational database designed to manage the operations of an online bookstore. It provides functionality to store and retrieve information about books, customers, and their orders.

This project includes:

* **Database schema design** with three main tables: `BOOKS`, `CUSTOMERS`, and `ORDERS`
* **SQL queries** to perform key business operations such as:

  * Tracking inventory
  * Analyzing sales performance
  * Identifying customer trends
  * Calculating revenue and order statistics

The project is built using **SQL** and is ideal for learning and practicing relational database concepts, foreign key relationships, data aggregation, and query optimization.

Use cases for this project include:

* Inventory and stock management
* Sales and revenue reporting
* Customer behavior analysis
* Genre-based filtering and ranking of books

This project is well-suited for students, database learners, and developers looking to build or improve their skills in SQL and database design.
